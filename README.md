## Intro
This was the latest Free version of FusionCMS!

It was forked from kjanko's bitbucket.

If you have any fixes, modifications or etc.. you can make a pull request, i'll add it.

## Modifications for [Opencataclysm Project](https://github.com/cbunting99/OpenCataclysm)

The Free Version of FusionCMS is being modified for use with my OpenCataclysm Project.
However, this will still install and work for most trinitycore servers as far as I am
aware.. Such as 3.3.5a, 4.3.4, and possibly MOP.

## NOTICE / THIS ISN'T NULLED / NO LICENSE BYPASS:

This is not Nulled.. It doesn't have a license bypass! It is a FREE RELEASE VERSION!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation:

Please create your empty database first (fusioncms or whatever) before visiting localhost or
your IP/Domain as you will not be able to complete the installation and it can be a pain!

## [OpenCataclysm Installation](https://github.com/cbunting99/OpenCataclysm):
1. Create fusioncms empty database!
2. In the worldserver console, type .account create youusername password (For your FusionCMS Admin)
3. Process to visit localhost/IP/Domain..
4. Server UN/PW will be root/ascent
5. DB's are auth/characters/world
6. Choose Trinity 4.3.4 RBAC with RA... (worldserver.conf, set RA = 1) This is easiest method to use FCMS + Server.


These steps should be simular for all other TinityCore Servers. I haven't tested all of the included Emulator Connectors.
